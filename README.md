# PiicoDev® RFID Module

![](https://core-electronics.com.au/media/catalog/product/p/i/piicodev-rfid-module.jpg)

This is the repo for the Core Electronics [PiicoDev RFID Module](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE08086).

The PiicoDev® RFID Module will get you started with reading (and writing) RFID tags. Use unique tag IDs to identify users, track your equipment, or make your own vending machine. Getting started is easy - there's no need for soldering, and great PiicoDev guides for Python / MicroPython. If you prefer to go freestyle, each RFID module features a standard breakout header for breadboarding or wires, and the small size makes it ideal for compact projects. This module is compatible with modern RFID / NFC tags: NTAG213, NTAG203 and Classic (aka. Mifare) tags. That means you can not only read the tag ID, but also read or write data to the tag. For more advanced projects, you can connect up to four RFID modules on a single bus. Each device address is selectable using the address switch (labelled ASW) which can select addresses from 0x2C (factory default) to 0x2F.
